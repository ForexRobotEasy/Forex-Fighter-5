# Forex Fighter 5

This code is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team to create a trading robot that can trade seven currency pairs: EURJPY, GBPCHF, EURGBP, USDCAD, AUDNZD, USDJPY, and AUDCAD. The robot utilizes built-in indicators to identify repetitive patterns in the forex market and converts them into profitable trading opportunities using artificial intelligence (AI). The decision-making process is controlled by two neural networks, which must agree on a trade's viability based on a pattern repetition probability of at least 85%. Trades are initiated only when this threshold is met.

## Currency Pairs to Trade

The currency pairs that this robot can trade are as follows:

- EURJPY
- GBPCHF
- EURGBP
- USDCAD
- AUDNZD
- USDJPY
- AUDCAD

## Trading Robot Code

The main function of the trading robot is the `OnTick()` function, which continuously scans the forex market for trading opportunities. Inside this function, the code iterates through each currency pair specified in the `currencyPairs` array and checks if the pattern repetition probability is above 85% using the `IdentifyPatternRepetition()` function. If the probability is met, the `DecisionByNeuralNetworks()` function is called to make a decision based on the agreement of the two neural networks. If the decision is positive, the `OpenTrade()` function is called to initiate a trade for the corresponding currency pair.

The `IdentifyPatternRepetition()` function uses built-in indicators to identify repetitive patterns in the market for a specific currency pair. Currently, the function returns a placeholder value of 90% for the pattern repetition probability. This value can be replaced with the actual calculation once the algorithm is implemented.

The `DecisionByNeuralNetworks()` function makes a decision based on the agreement of the two neural networks. It returns a placeholder value of `true` for a positive decision, which can be replaced with the actual decision-making process using the neural networks.

The `OpenTrade()` function is responsible for opening a trade for the specified currency pair. The actual code to open a trade is not provided in this sample, but it can be implemented based on the broker's API or trading platform.

## Product Description

Forex Fighter 5 is a powerful trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade seven different currency pairs: EURJPY, GBPCHF, EURGBP, USDCAD, AUDNZD, USDJPY, and AUDCAD. The robot utilizes advanced AI algorithms and built-in indicators to identify repetitive patterns in the forex market. These patterns are then converted into profitable trading opportunities, ensuring high accuracy in decision-making.

Forex Fighter 5 is equipped with two neural networks that work in tandem to provide reliable trade signals. These neural networks analyze the pattern repetition probability of at least 85% before initiating a trade. This ensures that only the most favorable trading opportunities are considered, maximizing profit potential.
